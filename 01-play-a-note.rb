# Lines starting with a # (like this one) are comments ignored by the computer
# Sonic-Pi uses the midi note system
# Each note has a number value
# 60 is a C note
# To play a note we use a command : play
# We need to give the command an argument which is the note number to play

# command = play
# argument = 60
play 60
